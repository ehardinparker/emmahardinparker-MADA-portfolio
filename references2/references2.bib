              Background 
              West Nile virus (WNV), the most widely distributed flavivirus causing encephalitis globally, is a vector-borne pathogen of global importance. The changing climate is poised to reshape the landscape of various infectious diseases, particularly vector-borne ones like WNV. Understanding the anticipated geographical and range shifts in disease transmission due to climate change, alongside effective adaptation strategies, is critical for mitigating future public health impacts. This scoping review aims to consolidate evidence on the impact of climate change on WNV and to identify a spectrum of applicable adaptation strategies. 
             
             
              Main body 
               
                We systematically analyzed research articles from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. Our criteria included English-language research articles published between 2007 and 2023, focusing on the impacts of climate change on WNV and related adaptation strategies. We extracted data concerning study objectives, populations, geographical focus, and specific findings. Literature was categorized into two primary themes: 1) climate-WNV associations, and 2) climate change impacts on WNV transmission, providing a clear understanding. Out of 2168 articles reviewed, 120 met our criteria. Most evidence originated from North America (59.2\%) and Europe (28.3\%), with a primary focus on human cases (31.7\%). Studies on climate-WNV correlations ( 
                n 
                 = 83) highlighted temperature (67.5\%) as a pivotal climate factor. In the analysis of climate change impacts on WNV ( 
                n 
                 = 37), most evidence suggested that climate change may affect the transmission and distribution of WNV, with the extent of the impact depending on local and regional conditions. Although few studies directly addressed the implementation of adaptation strategies for climate-induced disease transmission, the proposed strategies ( 
                n 
                 = 49) fell into six categories: 1) surveillance and monitoring (38.8\%), 2) predictive modeling (18.4\%), 3) cross-disciplinary collaboration (16.3\%), 4) environmental management (12.2\%), 5) public education (8.2\%), and 6) health system readiness (6.1\%). Additionally, we developed an accessible online platform to summarize the evidence on climate change impacts on WNV transmission ( 
                https://2xzl2o-neaop.shinyapps.io/WNVScopingReview/ 
                ). 
               
             
             
              Conclusions 
              This review reveals that climate change may affect the transmission and distribution of WNV, but the literature reflects only a small share of the global WNV dynamics. There is an urgent need for adaptive responses to anticipate and respond to the climate-driven spread of WNV. Nevertheless, studies focusing on these adaptation responses are sparse compared to those examining the impacts of climate change. Further research on the impacts of climate change and adaptation strategies for vector-borne diseases, along with more comprehensive evidence synthesis, is needed to inform effective policy responses tailored to local contexts.},

            In North America, the geographic distribution, ecology, and vectorial capacity of a diverse assemblage of mosquito species belonging to the genus Culex determine patterns of West Nile virus transmission and disease risk. East of the Mississippi River, mostly ornithophagic Culex pipiens L. complex mosquitoes drive intense enzootic transmission with relatively small numbers of human cases. Westward, the presence of highly competent Culex tarsalis (Coquillett) under arid climate and hot summers defines the regions with the highest human risk. West Nile virus human risk distribution is not uniform geographically or temporally within all regions. Notable geographic ‘hotspots’ persist with occasional severe outbreaks. Despite two decades of comprehensive research, several questions remain unresolved, such as the role of non-Culex bridge vectors, which are not involved in the enzootic cycle, but may be involved in virus transmission to humans. The absence of bridge vectors also may help to explain the frequent lack of West Nile virus ‘spillover’ into human populations despite very intense enzootic amplification in the eastern United States. This article examines vectorial capacity and the eco-epidemiology of West Nile virus mosquito vectors in four geographic regions of North America and presents some of the unresolved questions.},

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to systematically review and summarize the current evidence from epidemiological studies that evaluated this relationship. Materials and Methods. PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang, and VIP databases were searched for studies published up to May 2021. Prospective cohort studies that reported the relationship between hypertension and insomnia in adults were included. Data were extracted or provided by the authors according to the prevalence rate, incidence rate, unadjusted or adjusted odds ratio (OR), and 95\% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed by I2 statistics. ORs were pooled by using random-effects models. Results. A total of 23 prospective studies were identified. Twenty cohort studies recorded OR-adjusted value with the outcome for hypertension (OR = 1.11, 95\% CI: 1.07–1.16; I2 = 83.9\%), and three cohort studies reported OR-adjusted value with the outcome for insomnia (OR = 1.20, 95\%CI: 1.08–1.32; I2 = 35.1\%). Subgroup analysis showed that early morning awakening and composite insomnia were significantly associated with hypertension. Conclusions. The result indicates a possible bidirectional association between hypertension and insomnia. Early identification and prevention of insomnia in hypertension patients are needed, and vice versa.},

Methods: We analyzed 12,166 adults aged 30–79 years who participated in the 2007–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Sleep duration, self-reported trouble sleeping and sleep disorders were collected using a standardized questionnaire. We included three sleep factors (sleep duration, self-reported trouble sleeping and sleep disorder) to generate an overall sleep score, ranging from 0 to 3. We then defined the sleep pattern as “healthy sleep pattern” (overall sleep score = 3), “intermediate sleep pattern” (overall sleep score = 2), and “poor sleep pattern” (0 ≤ overall sleep score ≤ 1) based on the overall sleep score. The definition of hypertension was based on self-reported antihypertensive medication use or biological measurement (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg). We used weighted logistic regression models to investigate the associations between sleep and hypertension. Results: The overall prevalence of hypertension was 37.8\%. A short sleep duration (OR = 1.20, 95\% CI: 1.08 to 1.33, p = 0.001), self-reported trouble sleeping (OR = 1.45, 95\% CI: 1.28 to 1.65, p {\textless} 0.001) and sleep disorder (OR = 1.33, 95\% CI: 1.07 to 1.66, p = 0.012) were related to the risk of hypertension. Poor sleep patterns were closely correlated with the risk of hypertension (OR = 1.90, 95\% CI: 1.62 to 2.24).

              Background 
              West Nile virus (WNV), the most widely distributed flavivirus causing encephalitis globally, is a vector-borne pathogen of global importance. The changing climate is poised to reshape the landscape of various infectious diseases, particularly vector-borne ones like WNV. Understanding the anticipated geographical and range shifts in disease transmission due to climate change, alongside effective adaptation strategies, is critical for mitigating future public health impacts. This scoping review aims to consolidate evidence on the impact of climate change on WNV and to identify a spectrum of applicable adaptation strategies. 
             
             
              Main body 
               
                We systematically analyzed research articles from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. Our criteria included English-language research articles published between 2007 and 2023, focusing on the impacts of climate change on WNV and related adaptation strategies. We extracted data concerning study objectives, populations, geographical focus, and specific findings. Literature was categorized into two primary themes: 1) climate-WNV associations, and 2) climate change impacts on WNV transmission, providing a clear understanding. Out of 2168 articles reviewed, 120 met our criteria. Most evidence originated from North America (59.2\%) and Europe (28.3\%), with a primary focus on human cases (31.7\%). Studies on climate-WNV correlations ( 
                n 
                 = 83) highlighted temperature (67.5\%) as a pivotal climate factor. In the analysis of climate change impacts on WNV ( 
                n 
                 = 37), most evidence suggested that climate change may affect the transmission and distribution of WNV, with the extent of the impact depending on local and regional conditions. Although few studies directly addressed the implementation of adaptation strategies for climate-induced disease transmission, the proposed strategies ( 
                n 
                 = 49) fell into six categories: 1) surveillance and monitoring (38.8\%), 2) predictive modeling (18.4\%), 3) cross-disciplinary collaboration (16.3\%), 4) environmental management (12.2\%), 5) public education (8.2\%), and 6) health system readiness (6.1\%). Additionally, we developed an accessible online platform to summarize the evidence on climate change impacts on WNV transmission ( 
                https://2xzl2o-neaop.shinyapps.io/WNVScopingReview/ 
                ). 
               
             
             
              Conclusions 
              This review reveals that climate change may affect the transmission and distribution of WNV, but the literature reflects only a small share of the global WNV dynamics. There is an urgent need for adaptive responses to anticipate and respond to the climate-driven spread of WNV. Nevertheless, studies focusing on these adaptation responses are sparse compared to those examining the impacts of climate change. Further research on the impacts of climate change and adaptation strategies for vector-borne diseases, along with more comprehensive evidence synthesis, is needed to inform effective policy responses tailored to local contexts.},

            In North America, the geographic distribution, ecology, and vectorial capacity of a diverse assemblage of mosquito species belonging to the genus Culex determine patterns of West Nile virus transmission and disease risk. East of the Mississippi River, mostly ornithophagic Culex pipiens L. complex mosquitoes drive intense enzootic transmission with relatively small numbers of human cases. Westward, the presence of highly competent Culex tarsalis (Coquillett) under arid climate and hot summers defines the regions with the highest human risk. West Nile virus human risk distribution is not uniform geographically or temporally within all regions. Notable geographic ‘hotspots’ persist with occasional severe outbreaks. Despite two decades of comprehensive research, several questions remain unresolved, such as the role of non-Culex bridge vectors, which are not involved in the enzootic cycle, but may be involved in virus transmission to humans. The absence of bridge vectors also may help to explain the frequent lack of West Nile virus ‘spillover’ into human populations despite very intense enzootic amplification in the eastern United States. This article examines vectorial capacity and the eco-epidemiology of West Nile virus mosquito vectors in four geographic regions of North America and presents some of the unresolved questions.},

The changing climate is poised to reshape the landscape of various infectious diseases, particularly vector-borne ones like WNV. Understanding the anticipated geographical and range shifts in disease transmission due to climate change, alongside effective adaptation strategies, is critical for mitigating future public health impacts. This scoping review aims to consolidate evidence on the impact of climate change on WNV and to identify a spectrum of applicable adaptation strategies. Main body We systematically analyzed research articles from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCOhost.

East of the Mississippi River, mostly ornithophagic Culex pipiens L. complex mosquitoes drive intense enzootic transmission with relatively small numbers of human cases. Westward, the presence of highly competent Culex tarsalis (Coquillett) under arid climate and hot summers defines the regions with the highest human risk. West Nile virus human risk distribution is not uniform geographically or temporally within all regions. Notable geographic ‘hotspots’ persist with occasional severe outbreaks. Despite two decades of comprehensive research, several questions remain unresolved, such as the role of non-Culex bridge vectors, which are not involved in the enzootic cycle, but may be involved in virus transmission to humans. The absence of bridge vectors also may help to explain the frequent lack of West Nile virus ‘spillover’ into human populations despite very intense enzootic amplification in the eastern United States.

	abstract = {Abstract Background West Nile virus (WNV), the most widely distributed flavivirus causing encephalitis globally, is a vector-borne pathogen of global importance. The changing climate is poised to reshape the landscape of various infectious diseases, particularly vector-borne ones like WNV. Understanding the anticipated geographical and range shifts in disease transmission due to climate change, alongside effective adaptation strategies, is critical for mitigating future public health impacts. This scoping review aims to consolidate evidence on the impact of climate change on WNV and to identify a spectrum of applicable adaptation strategies. Main body We systematically analyzed research articles from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. Our criteria included English-language research articles published between 2007 and 2023, focusing on the impacts of climate change on WNV and related adaptation strategies. We extracted data concerning study objectives, populations, geographical focus, and specific findings. Literature was categorized into two primary themes: 1) climate-WNV associations, and 2) climate change impacts on WNV transmission, providing a clear understanding. Out of 2168 articles reviewed, 120 met our criteria. Most evidence originated from North America (59.2\%) and Europe (28.3\%), with a primary focus on human cases (31.7\%). Studies on climate-WNV correlations ( n = 83) highlighted temperature (67.5\%) as a pivotal climate factor. In the analysis of climate change impacts on WNV ( n = 37), most evidence suggested that climate change may affect the transmission and distribution of WNV, with the extent of the impact depending on local and regional conditions. Although few studies directly addressed the implementation of adaptation strategies for climate-induced disease transmission, the proposed strategies ( n = 49) fell into six categories: 1) surveillance and monitoring (38.8\%), 2) predictive modeling (18.4\%), 3) cross-disciplinary collaboration (16.3\%), 4) environmental management (12.2\%), 5) public education (8.2\%), and 6) health system readiness (6.1\%). Additionally, we developed an accessible online platform to summarize the evidence on climate change impacts on WNV transmission ( https://2xzl2o-neaop.shinyapps.io/WNVScopingReview/ ). Conclusions This review reveals that climate change may affect the transmission and distribution of WNV, but the literature reflects only a small share of the global WNV dynamics. There is an urgent need for adaptive responses to anticipate and respond to the climate-driven spread of WNV. Nevertheless, studies focusing on these adaptation responses are sparse compared to those examining the impacts of climate change. Further research on the impacts of climate change and adaptation strategies for vector-borne diseases, along with more comprehensive evidence synthesis, is needed to inform effective policy responses tailored to local contexts.},
