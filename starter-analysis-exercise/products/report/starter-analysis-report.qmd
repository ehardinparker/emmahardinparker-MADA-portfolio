# Summary/Abstract

For the first analysis report, I explored the relationships between height, weight, and gender along with two new variables: smoking status and age. The determined age range was 18-65 and smoking status had three categorical options: Yes, No, or NA. Plots were developed to show the relationship between Height and Smoking_Status as well as age and height.

# Introduction 

## Description of data and data source

The original data file was stored under exampledata.xls and contained three variables: height, weight, and gender. Two new variables, age and smoking_status were added into the table and codebook into the file exampledata2.xls. 

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

I wanted to determine whether there were relationships between age and height, as well as height and smoking status. To do this, I constructed a scatterplot, boxplot, and linear regression model.

# Methods 


## Data import and cleaning
```{r}
data_location <- here::here("starter-analysis-exercise","data","processed-data","processeddata2.rds")

#load data. 
mydata <- readRDS(data_location)
```


## Statistical analysis

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis



@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. **I recommend the `here` package, but I'm showing the other approach here just in case you encounter it.**

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables-files/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```



## Basic statistical analysis



@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```


Boxplot of Smoking Status & Height 
```{r}
p5 <- mydata |>
  ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::aes(x = Smoking_Status, y = Height) +
  ggplot2::geom_boxplot()

plot(p5)

figure_file = here::here(
  "starter-analysis-exercise",
  "results",
  "figures",
  "height-smoking-stratified.png"
)
ggplot2::ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot = p5) 
```
The boxplot indicates that individuals who report smoking are, on average, slightly taller than those who did not report smoking. 

Scatterplot of Height and Age 

```{r}
p6 <- mydata |>
  ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::aes(x = Age, y = Height) +
  ggplot2::geom_point()

plot(p6)

figure_file = here::here(
  "starter-analysis-exercise",
  "results",
  "figures",
  "height-age-stratified.png"
)
ggplot2::ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot = p6) 
```
There is no apparent association between age and height. 



## Full analysis

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```


Model of Height ~ Smoking_Status + Age 

```{r}
#### Third model fit
# fit linear model using height as outcome, smoking status and age as predictor
lmfit3 <- lm(Height ~ Smoking_Status + Age, mydata)

#place results from fit into a data frame with the tidy function
lmtable3 <- broom::tidy(lmfit3)

#look at fit results
print(lmtable3)

#save fit results table 

table_file3 = here("starter-analysis-exercise", "results", "tables-files", "resulttable3.rds")
```

THe linear regression model with height as the outcome and smoking_status and age as predictors yieled no statistically significant results suggesting there is not enough evidence that smoking_status and age are indicative of height. This contrasts the preliminary analysis of the boxplot that suggested there may be a positive association between height and smoking_status.

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

Overall, there is no statistically significant evidence to suggest that smoking_status and age have any association with height, weight, or gender. 


## Strengths and Limitations

One limitation of this analysis involves the two added variables: smoking_status and age. These variables were arbitrarily added for the sake of performing introductory exploratory data analysis, and not to answer any pressing research questions.

## Conclusions

There is no evidence to suggest there are any significant associations between height, gender, weight, smoking status, or age.

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses. 

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
