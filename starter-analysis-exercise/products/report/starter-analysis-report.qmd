The structure below is one possible setup for a data analysis project (including the course project). For a manuscript, adjust as needed. 
You don't need to have exactly these sections, but the content covering those sections should be addressed.

This uses MS Word as output format. [See here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html) for more information. You can switch to other formats, like html or pdf. See [the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/) for other formats.

# Summary/Abstract

For the first analysis report, I explored the relationships between height, weight, and gender along with two new variables: smoking status and age. The determined age range was 18-65 and smoking status had three categorical options: Yes, No, or NA. Plots were developed to show the relationship between Height and Smoking_Status as well as age and height.

# Introduction 

## Description of data and data source

The original data file was stored under exampledata.xls and contained three variables: height, weight, and gender. Two new variables, age and smoking_status were added into the table and codebook into the file exampledata2.xls. 

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

I wanted to determine whether there were relationships between age and height, as well as height and smoking status. To do this, I constructed a scatterplot, boxplot, and linear regression model.

# Methods 

_Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement._




## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._


## Statistical analysis
_Explain anything related to your statistical analyses._

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._


@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. **I recommend the `here` package, but I'm showing the other approach here just in case you encounter it.**

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables-files/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```



## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._


@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```


Boxplot of Smoking Status & Height 
```{r}
p5 <- mydata |>
  ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::aes(x = Smoking_Status, y = Height) +
  ggplot2::geom_boxplot()

plot(p5)

figure_file = here::here(
  "starter-analysis-exercise",
  "results",
  "figures",
  "height-smoking-stratified.png"
)
ggplot2::ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot = p5) 
```
The boxplot indicates that individuals who report smoking are, on average, slightly taller than those who did not report smoking. 

Scatterplot of Height and Age 

```{r}
p6 <- mydata |>
  ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::aes(x = Age, y = Height) +
  ggplot2::geom_point()

plot(p6)

figure_file = here::here(
  "starter-analysis-exercise",
  "results",
  "figures",
  "height-age-stratified.png"
)
ggplot2::ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot = p6) 
```
There is no apparent association between age and height. 



## Full analysis

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```


Model of Height ~ Smoking_Status + Age 

```{r}
lmtable3
```

THe linear regression model with height as the outcome and smoking_status and age as predictors yieled no statistically significant results suggesting there is not enough evidence that smoking_status and age are indicative of height. This contrasts the preliminary analysis of the boxplot that suggested there may be a positive association between height and smoking_status.

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

Overall, there is no statistically significant evidence to suggest that smoking_status and age have any association with height, weight, or gender. 


## Strengths and Limitations

One limitation of this analysis involves the two added variables: smoking_status and age. These variables were arbitrarily added for the sake of performing introductory exploratory data analysis, and not to answer any pressing research questions. 



This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses. 

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
