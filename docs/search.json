Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

It has some NA values that are character strings instead of actual NAs, so we’ll need to code those as true missing values. Then we’ll make it a factor variable as well.

It looks correct, so we are done.\nAll done, data is clean now.\nLet’s assign at the end to some final variable, this makes it easier to add further cleaning steps above.\n\nprocesseddata &lt;- d5\n\n\n\nSave data\nFinally, we save the clean data as RDS file. I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\n  \"starter-analysis-exercise\",\n  \"data\",\n  \"processed-data\",\n  \"processeddata2.rds\"\n)\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at D:/emmahardinparker-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

manually sorted africadata by country to see how population and life_expectancy change over time. By looking at the data this way, I could see that over time as population size increased, life expectancy increased as well. For example, from 1960 to 2015, Algeria’s population increased from 11,124,892to 39,666,519 and life expectancy increased from 47.50 years to 76.40 years.\nFinding which years have NA values\n\ncolSums(is.na(africadata)) ##finding out how many NA values exist for each column \n\n         country             year infant_mortality  life_expectancy \n               0                0              226                0 \n       fertility       population              gdp        continent \n              51               51              637                0 \n          region \n               0 \n\nwhere_na_infant &lt;- africadata %&gt;% ## creating object that clearly shows which years have missing values for infant mortality\n  filter(is.na(infant_mortality))\n\nFiltering africadata to only include the year 2000\n\nafrica_twothousand &lt;- africadata %&gt;%\n  filter(year == \"2000\")\n\n\nstr(africa_twothousand) ## double checking structure\n\n'data.frame':   51 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ country         : Factor w/ 185 levels \"Albania\",\"Algeria\",..: 2 3 18 22 26 27 29 31 32 33 ...\n $ year            : int  2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 ...\n $ infant_mortality: num  33.9 128.3 89.3 52.4 96.2 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  73.3 52.3 57.2 47.6 52.6 46.7 54.3 68.4 45.3 51.5 ...\n $ fertility       : num  2.51 6.84 5.98 3.41 6.59 7.06 5.62 3.7 5.45 7.35 ...\n $ population      : num  31183658 15058638 6949366 1736579 11607944 ...\n $ gdp             : num  5.48e+10 9.13e+09 2.25e+09 5.63e+09 2.61e+09 ...\n $ continent       : Factor w/ 5 levels \"Africa\",\"Americas\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ region          : Factor w/ 22 levels \"Australia and New Zealand\",..: 11 10 20 17 20 5 10 20 10 10 ...\n\nsummary(africa_twothousand) ## triple checking structure \n\n         country        year      infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Algeria     : 1   Min.   :2000   Min.   : 12.30   Min.   :37.60  \n Angola      : 1   1st Qu.:2000   1st Qu.: 60.80   1st Qu.:51.75  \n Benin       : 1   Median :2000   Median : 80.30   Median :54.30  \n Botswana    : 1   Mean   :2000   Mean   : 78.93   Mean   :56.36  \n Burkina Faso: 1   3rd Qu.:2000   3rd Qu.:103.30   3rd Qu.:60.00  \n Burundi     : 1   Max.   :2000   Max.   :143.30   Max.   :75.00  \n (Other)     :45                                                  \n   fertility       population             gdp               continent \n Min.   :1.990   Min.   :    81154   Min.   :2.019e+08   Africa  :51  \n 1st Qu.:4.150   1st Qu.:  2304687   1st Qu.:1.274e+09   Americas: 0  \n Median :5.550   Median :  8799165   Median :3.238e+09   Asia    : 0  \n Mean   :5.156   Mean   : 15659800   Mean   :1.155e+10   Europe  : 0  \n 3rd Qu.:5.960   3rd Qu.: 17391242   3rd Qu.:8.654e+09   Oceania : 0  \n Max.   :7.730   Max.   :122876723   Max.   :1.329e+11                \n                                                                      \n                       region  \n Eastern Africa           :16  \n Western Africa           :16  \n Middle Africa            : 8  \n Northern Africa          : 6  \n Southern Africa          : 5  \n Australia and New Zealand: 0  \n (Other)                  : 0  \n\n\nPlotting life expectancy as a function of infant mortality for the year 2000\n\nexpect_infant_plot2000 &lt;- ggplot(africa_twothousand, aes(x = infant_mortality, y = life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nexpect_infant_plot2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting life expectancy as a function of population for the year 2000\n\nexpect_pop_plot2000 &lt;- ggplot(africa_twothousand, aes(x = population, y = life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  scale_y_continuous()\n\nexpect_pop_plot2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning simple model fits\n\nfit1 &lt;- lm(life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, africa_twothousand)\n\nfit2 &lt;- lm(life_expectancy ~ population, africa_twothousand)\n\nSummary of both fit models\n\nsummary(fit1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = africa_twothousand)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-22.6651  -3.7087   0.9914   4.0408   8.6817 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

We’ll now make a plot to see how margarine consumption has changed over the years.\n\n#make an object with just margarine consumption and years\nyearmarg &lt;- subset(divorce_margarine, select = c(margarine_consumption_per_capita, year))\n#plot margarine consumption as a function of the year\nmargarine_year_plot &lt;- ggplot(yearmarg, aes(x = margarine_consumption_per_capita, y = year)) +\n  geom_point()\n#plot it\nplot(margarine_year_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur plot indicates that margarine consumption has decreased over the years. The year is negatively correlated with both margarine consumption and divorce rates; however, divorce seems to be more frequent in years with higher margarine consumption. To make sure that America’s consumption of margarine is truly the reason for failed marriages in Maine, we’ll create some linear models. First, we’ll fit just margarine consumption as a predictor for divorce rates. Then, we’ll fit both year and margarine as predictors for divorce rates.\n\n#fit margarine as a predictor for divorce\nfit_margarine_only &lt;- lm(divorce_rate_maine ~ margarine_consumption_per_capita, divorce_margarine)\n\n#fit marg and year as predicotrs for divorce\nfit_margarine_year &lt;- lm(divorce_rate_maine ~ margarine_consumption_per_capita + year, divorce_margarine)\n\n#call both plots\nsummary(fit_margarine_only)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = divorce_rate_maine ~ margarine_consumption_per_capita, \n    data = divorce_margarine)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.05583 -0.01816 -0.01452  0.03601  0.04625 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                 Estimate Std.

Both models apparently describe most of the variation as well given our R-squared values. These results would seem to indicate that we can attribute more frequent divorces in Maine to the amount of margarine Americans consume a year. However, if given a bit of thought, this correlation makes no sense and should not be equated to causation. Regardless, it’s a fun analysis to run."

    "text": "Headshot\n\n\n\nEducation & Work Experience\nI received my BS in Public Health and a minor in Data Analytics from Furman University in 2023. While at Furman, I had the opportunity to intern and work with the Institute for the Advancement of Community Health (IACH) as an evaluation coordinator. Throughout my time at IACH, I had the privilege of working with community partners such as LiveWell Greenville, the Well-Being Partnership of Greenville (WBP), and the Greenville County School System on various evaluation projects. My main research and evaluation efforts were geared towards childhood obesity, food access, ad mental health, One of my main projects was assisting in the development of a Mental Health Indicator Dashboard for the WBP.\n\n\nSoftware Experience & Looking Forward\nI have experience with RStudio, LaTeX, and RMarkdown from previous coursework and evaluation projects. However, I am looking to finish this class with a greater understanding of RStudio as it particularly relates to LaTeX and RMarkdown. Additionally, I am excited to be exposed to new programs and softwares! Mainly, I am looking to become more comfortable performing analyses on a variety of different data and to gain more professional knowledge of these programs. With my minor in Data Analytics, I was allowed the exposure to statistical analysis, specifically in R.\n\n\nMe outside of Academia!\nIn my free time, my favorite thing to study is beer! I am currently working toward my second level of certification under the Cicerone Program which is, for lack of a better word, a program geared to helping individuals become “sommeliers” of beer. When I am not in class or in the library, you can most likely find me behind the bar at Creature Comforts. One of the main perks of working at a brewery is being exposed to the analytics involved in brewing beer! This article explains how Beer30 software can be used to better manage brewing data as a whole and increase predictive analysis measures. Come by and grab a pint!"

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/emmahardinparker/Desktop/BIOS8060E/emmahardinparker-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files.\nAnd sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n# Setup\n```{r}\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\nLoad the data.\n```{r}\n#Path to data.

Structure the folders inside `results` such that they make sense for your specific analysis. Provide enough documentation that someone can understand what you are doing and what goes where. `readme.md` files inside each folder are a good idea.\n# Data exploration through figures\nHistogram plots for the continuous outcomes.\nHeight first.\n```{r}\np1 &lt;- mydata %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=Height)) + geom_histogram()\nplot(p1)\nfigure_file = here(“starter-analysis-exercise”,“results”,“figures”,“height-distribution.png”)\nggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p1)\n```\nNow weights.\n```{r}\np2 &lt;- mydata %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=Weight)) + geom_histogram()\nplot(p2)\nfigure_file = here(“starter-analysis-exercise”,“results”,“figures”,“weight-distribution.png”)\nggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p2)\n```\nNow height as function of weight.\n```{r}\np3 &lt;- mydata %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=Height, y=Weight)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=‘lm’)\nplot(p3)\nfigure_file = here(“starter-analysis-exercise”,“results”,“figures”,“height-weight.png”)\nggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p3)\n```\nOnce more height as function of weight, stratified by gender. Note that there is so little data, it’s a bit silly. But we’ll plot it anyway.\n```{r}\np4 &lt;- mydata %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=Height, y=Weight, color = Gender)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=‘lm’)\nplot(p4)\nfigure_file = here(“starter-analysis-exercise”,“results”,“figures”,“height-weight-stratified.png”)\nggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p4)\n```\n# Notes\nFor your own explorations, tables and figures can be “quick and dirty”. As long as you can see what’s going on, there is no need to polish them. That’s in contrast to figures you’ll produce for your final products (paper, report, presentation, website, etc.). Those should look as nice, polished and easy to understand as possible."
